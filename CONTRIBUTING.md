## Setting up the environment

### With `uv`

We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies because it will automatically provision a Python environment with the expected Python version. To set it up, run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
```

Or [install uv manually](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and run:

```sh
$ uv sync --all-extras
```

You can then run scripts using `uv run python script.py` or by manually activating the virtual environment:

```sh
# manually activate - https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work
$ source .venv/bin/activate

# now you can omit the `uv run` prefix
$ python script.py
```

### Without `uv`

Alternatively if you don't want to install `uv`, you can stick with the standard `pip` setup by ensuring you have the Python version specified in `.python-version`, create a virtual environment however you desire and then install dependencies using this command:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements-dev.lock
```

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never
modify the contents of the `src/aibanking/lib/` and `examples/` directories.

## Adding and running examples

All files in the `examples/` directory are not modified by the generator and can be freely edited or added to.

```py
# add an example to examples/<your-example>.py

#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run python
…
```

```sh
$ chmod +x examples/<your-example>.py
# run the example against your api
$ ./examples/<your-example>.py
```

## Using the repository from source

If you’d like to use the repository from source, you can either install from git or link to a cloned repository:

To install via git:

```sh
$ pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/diplomat-bit/aibank.git
```

Alternatively, you can build from source and install the wheel file:

Building this package will create two files in the `dist/` directory, a `.tar.gz` containing the source files and a `.whl` that can be used to install the package efficiently.

To create a distributable version of the library, all you have to do is run this command:

```sh
$ uv build
# or
$ python -m build
```

Then to install:

```sh
$ pip install ./path-to-wheel-file.whl
```

## Running tests

Most tests require you to [set up a mock server](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) against the OpenAPI spec to run the tests.

```sh
# you will need npm installed
$ npx prism mock path/to/your/openapi.yml
```

```sh
$ ./scripts/test
```

## Linting and formatting

This repository uses [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and
[black](https://github.com/psf/black) to format the code in the repository.

To lint:

```sh
$ ./scripts/lint
```

To format and fix all ruff issues automatically:

```sh
$ ./scripts/format
```

## Publishing and releases

Changes made to this repository via the automated release PR pipeline should publish to PyPI automatically. If
the changes aren't made through the automated pipeline, you may want to make releases manually.

### Publish with a GitHub workflow

You can release to package managers by using [the `Publish PyPI` GitHub action](https://www.github.com/diplomat-bit/aibank/actions/workflows/publish-pypi.yml). This requires a setup organization or repository secret to be set up.

### Publish manually

If you need to manually release a package, you can run the `bin/publish-pypi` script with a `PYPI_TOKEN` set on
the environment.

## Setting up the environment

This repository uses [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/).
Other package managers may work but are not officially supported for development.

To set up the repository, run:

```sh
$ pnpm install
$ pnpm build
```

This will install all the required dependencies and build output files to `dist/`.

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never
modify the contents of the `src/lib/` and `examples/` directories.

## Adding and running examples

All files in the `examples/` directory are not modified by the generator and can be freely edited or added to.

```ts
// add an example to examples/<your-example>.ts

#!/usr/bin/env -S npm run tsn -T
…
```

```sh
$ chmod +x examples/<your-example>.ts
# run the example against your api
$ pnpm tsn -T examples/<your-example>.ts
```

## Using the repository from source

If you’d like to use the repository from source, you can either install from git or link to a cloned repository:

To install via git:

```sh
$ npm install git+ssh://git@github.com:diplomat-bit/garbage-typescript.git
```

Alternatively, to link a local copy of the repo:

```sh
# Clone
$ git clone https://www.github.com/diplomat-bit/garbage-typescript
$ cd garbage-typescript

# With yarn
$ yarn link
$ cd ../my-package
$ yarn link garbage

# With pnpm
$ pnpm link --global
$ cd ../my-package
$ pnpm link -—global garbage
```

## Running tests

```sh
$ npx prism mock path/to/your/openapi.yml
```

```sh
$ pnpm run test
```

## Linting and formatting

This repository uses [prettier](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier) and
[eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) to format the code in the repository.

## Setting up the environment

To set up the repository, run:

```sh
$ ./scripts/bootstrap
$ ./scripts/build
```

This will install all the required dependencies and build the SDK.

You can also [install go 1.22+ manually](https://go.dev/doc/install).

## Modifying/Adding code

Most of the SDK is generated code. Modifications to code will be persisted between generations, but may
result in merge conflicts between manual patches and changes from the generator. The generator will never

# add an example to examples/<your-example>/main.go

package main

func main() {
  // ...
}
```

```sh
$ go run ./examples/<your-example>
```

## Using the repository from source

To use a local version of this library from source in another project, edit the `go.mod` with a replace
directive. This can be done through the CLI with the following:

```sh
$ go mod edit -replace github.com/diplomat-bit/jocall3-go=/path/to/jocall3-go
```

## Running tests

Most tests require you to [set up a mock server](https://github.com/stoplightio/prism) against the OpenAPI spec to run the tests.
