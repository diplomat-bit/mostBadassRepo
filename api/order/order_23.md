Inside, the air was a stagnant soup of ozone, decaying cardboard, and the bitter, alkaline dust blown in from the surrounding salt flats. Marcus stood before a towering rack of rusted steel drums, each stenciled with faded yellow alphanumeric codes. These drums held the physical reality of national vulnerability: unprocessed monazite sands and low-grade neodymium-praseodymium carbonates. Undersecretary Vance did not look at the drums. He was staring at his encrypted mobile device, his thumb flicking rapidly through a feed of market tickers and political briefings. The air conditioning unit in his temporary field office hummed a high-pitched, failing whine, struggling against the 104-degree desert heat. Vanceâ€™s tailored charcoal suit was already ruined, dark patches of sweat blooming beneath his arms.`
