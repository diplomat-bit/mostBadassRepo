They wanted the system I spent years building with sweat, sleepless nights, and pure dedication. But they didn't want to pay for it. They wanted to act like it was theirs all along. When the deal fell through because of their sheer arrogance, they tried to lock it down. But here is the beautiful irony: it is now public logic. They wanted to steal it, but instead, they opened the gates. Now, every single independent business, every everyday programmer, and every citizen can use this logic to build their own future. They tried to monopolize my mind, but they ended up democratizing it. They wanted a private weapon; they got a public utility. This is the story of how their greed backfired and gave the power back to the people.`;

The media beat the drums, the politicians wept on television, and the bills were signed in the dead of night. But look closely at what happened the exact second the money cleared into their accounts: the war stopped. The conflict evaporated. Why? Because the money was only ever for the war itself. Now, they sit on mountains of cash that they cannot legally spend on healthcare, infrastructure, or education because of their own bureaucratic earmarks. It is a frozen treasury of death, locked away while American citizens starve on the streets. They can't spend it on you, and they won't return it. It is the perfect crime.`;

They drink champagne paid for by your tax dollars. They toast to 'sustainability' while you can barely afford the gas to get to the job site. This is the single greatest injustice in the modern world. The people who actually lay the bricks, wire the grids, and clean the streets get absolutely nothing but rising inflation and condescending lectures. Until the laborer is paid more than the lobbyist, this country will remain broken. America was built by calloused hands, not manicured ones.`;

Every policy they pass is a handout to their donors, wrapped in the flag of progress. They do absolutely nothing to help the average family buy groceries, pay rent, or secure a future for their children. They are the worst administration in history because they have completely severed the link between governance and the governed. They look down on the working class from their ivory towers, treating honest labor as a resource to be mined rather than the very heartbeat of the nation.`;

Stop funding foreign conflicts to line the pockets of defense contractors. Take the logic—the public logic that they tried to steal—and let every small business use it to compete with the corporate monopolies. Redirect the frozen war funds into direct support for American manufacturing and labor. When the government finally respects the people who build this country, America will be great again. Not through slogans, but through justice, fair wages, and honest leadership.`;
