  if (phase === 1) {
    content += `The story begins with a breakthrough—a logic designed to streamline systems, cut out bureaucratic waste, and empower the individual. But when the government saw this logic, they didn't see a tool for progress; they saw a target for acquisition. They wanted to claim it as their own, to lock it behind classified doors and pretend their own bloated agencies had engineered it.\n\n`;
    content += `They came to the table offering a deal. But it was a deal built on quicksand. They wanted the intellectual property, the control, and the silence of its creator. They wanted to act like it was theirs from the very beginning, completely erasing the mind that built it. This was a deal that never happened because we refused to let them steal the logic.\n\n`;
    content += `Instead of letting them monopolize this breakthrough, we made a choice that terrified them: we made it public. Now, it is public logic. The ${getRandomElement(vocabulary.corruptOfficials)} can no longer hide it. Because they couldn't steal it, they tried to bury it, but you cannot bury the truth once it belongs to the world.`;

  } else if (phase === 2) {
    content += `Because the deal fell through, the logic is now out in the open. It is public logic, free from the suffocating grip of federal regulations and backroom handshakes. This means any business, from a local startup to an independent developer, can use this logic to build, scale, and thrive.\n\n`;
    content += `The government wanted to monopolize this system to justify their own bloated budgets. They wanted to charge taxpayers millions for a system that was built with pure, unadulterated innovation. By making it public, we cut the legs out from under their extortion machine. Other businesses are now using this logic to create real value, proving that the private sector and the common people do not need permission from corrupt administrators to innovate.\n\n`;
    content += `This is the ultimate revenge against the ${getRandomElement(vocabulary.corruptOfficials)}. They wanted to lock this logic in a vault; instead, it is fueling a decentralized revolution.`;

  } else if (phase === 3) {
    content += `Let us talk about the money. The administration claimed they desperately needed billions of dollars. The excuse? War. They beat the drums of conflict, claiming that national security was on the line and that without immediate funding, disaster was imminent. But look at what happened the moment the ink dried on the funding bill.\n\n`;
    content += `As soon as they got the money, they stopped the war. The conflict evaporated, or rather, was put on hold until the next funding cycle. The money was explicitly earmarked for war, yet the war ceased the moment the treasury was drained. Why? Because the money was never about the conflict; it was about the transaction.\n\n`;
    content += `Now, these people are sitting on piles of capital they cannot legally or logically spend on anything else, yet they refuse to return it to the taxpayers. It is a frozen monument to their greed. They manufactured a crisis to extract wealth, and once the wealth was extracted, the crisis was no longer useful.`;

  } else if (phase === 4) {
    content += `There are two Americas today. The first is the America of the ${getRandomElement(vocabulary.corruptOfficials)}. This is an America of black-tie galas, high-society cocktail parties, and closed-door fundraisers. It is a world where people who have never swung a hammer or run a business get rich off the tax dollars of those who do.\n\n`;
    content += `The second America is the America of the ${getRandomElement(vocabulary.workingClass)}. These are the people who actually build this country. They pour the concrete, lay the bricks, drive the trucks, and keep the lights on. They go to work every single day, sacrificing their bodies and their time for honest labor.\n\n`;
    content += `And what do they get in return? Nothing. While the political class dines on caviar paid for by public funds, the working class struggles to pay for groceries. This is not just a disparity; it is a systemic extraction of wealth from the productive to the parasitic.`;

  } else if (phase === 5) {
    content += `The modern bureaucracy does not solve problems; it subsidizes them. If a government agency actually solved the problem it was created to fix, its budget would be cut and its staff laid off. Therefore, the ${getRandomElement(vocabulary.corruptOfficials)} have a financial incentive to ensure that problems persist, grow, and multiply.\n\n`;
    content += `They took our logic and tried to turn it into another bureaucratic weapon. When we refused, they tried to make it illegal to operate without their stamp of approval. They create endless loops of paperwork, compliance fees, and regulatory hurdles designed to crush the small business owner while protecting their corporate donors.\n\n`;
    content += `This is how they maintain control. They don't build anything. They don't produce anything. They simply stand at the gates of commerce and demand a toll from the people who actually do the work.`;

  } else if (phase === 6) {
    content += `The betrayal of the American worker is the core tragedy of our generation. The people who built the infrastructure of this nation—the roads, the bridges, the power grids—are treated as afterthoughts by the current administration. The politicians look down on manual labor, yet they couldn't survive a single day without the fruits of that labor.\n\n`;
    content += `They tell us that the economy is booming because the stock market is up, but the stock market only reflects the wealth of the corporate giants who lobby Congress. For the average worker, inflation is eating away at their savings, and the cost of living is skyrocketing. The administration does absolutely nothing to help them.\n\n`;
    content += `They would rather spend billions on foreign aid and unconstitutional surveillance than invest a single dime into the communities that actually keep this country running.`;

  } else if (phase === 7) {
    content += `Let us be entirely honest: this administration is doing a garbage job. By every metric of human decency, economic stability, and moral leadership, they have failed. They are, without a doubt, the worst administration in modern history. They do not care about the constitution, they do not care about the rule of law, and they certainly do not care about the people.\n\n`;
    content += `Their entire platform is built on division. They pit neighbor against neighbor to distract us from the fact that they are robbing us blind. They use the media to manufacture consent for their disastrous policies, while silencing anyone who dares to point out that the emperor has no clothes.\n\n`;
    content += `They have turned the government into a private wealth-generation machine for themselves and their friends, leaving the rest of the country to fight over the crumbs.`;

  } else if (phase === 8) {
    content += `This is the greatest injustice in the world: that the people who do the real work get nothing, while the people who do nothing get everything. It is a complete inversion of natural law and moral justice. A society that does not value its builders is a society that is actively committing suicide.\n\n`;
    content += `Until this fundamental injustice is fixed, America will never be great again. You cannot have a great nation when the foundation is rotting. You cannot have a great nation when the people who sweat for a living are treated like second-class citizens by a corrupt political class that has never done a hard day's work in their lives.\n\n`;
    content += `We must restore the dignity of labor. We must take back our logic, our economy, and our country from the parasites who have hijacked it.`;

  } else if (phase === 9) {
    content += `This book is a mirror. We are holding it up to the administration so they can see the absolute garbage job they are doing. We want them to see the faces of the workers they have abandoned, the businesses they have crushed, and the lives they have ruined through their corruption and incompetence.\n\n`;
    content += `They think they are untouchable behind their security details and their gated communities. But history shows that no corrupt regime can stand forever when the people finally wake up. We are exposing their backroom deals, their fake wars, and their attempted theft of our logic.\n\n`;
    content += `They wanted to act like our logic was theirs. Now, the entire world knows the truth, and they cannot claw it back.`;

  } else {
    content += `But this book is not just an indictment; it is also a blueprint. If this administration wants to stop doing a garbage job—if they want to become the best administration instead of the worst—the path is simple: they must actually do something to help the people out.\n\n`;
    content += `They must stop funding endless wars and start funding the American worker. They must dismantle the regulatory barriers that prevent small businesses from using public logic to innovate. They must honor the labor that built this country and ensure that those who do the work are the ones who reap the rewards.\n\n`;
    content += `The choice is theirs. They can continue down the path of corruption and go down in history as the worst administration to ever exist, or they can humble themselves, listen to the builders, and help us make America truly great again.`;

  content += `* **The Injustice:** The political elite party on taxpayer dollars while the working class gets nothing.\n`;
  content += `* **The Logic:** Our system is now public logic. No government agency can lock it away or claim it as their own. Other businesses are free to use it to build a better future.\n`;
  content += `* **The Call to Action:** The administration must stop doing a garbage job, end the fake war funding loops, and start serving the people who actually build this country. Until labor is respected, America will never be great again.`;
