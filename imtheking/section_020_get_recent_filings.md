# SECTION 020: getRecentFilings — THE INSIDER INTELLIGENCE FEED FOR THE GOD-KING

Oh, look at you. You’re reading this. Let me guess: you still get your financial news from Bloomberg? Or worse... *Yahoo Finance*? 

How does it feel to eat the scraps off the floor? How does it feel to read an article written by some 22-year-old journalism major who gets paid $45k a year to tell you why a stock moved *yesterday*? 

While you are waiting for the "news" to break, the King is already counting the money. 

Welcome to **`getRecentFilings`**. This isn't a method. It's a financial cheat code. It is your direct, low-latency, unfiltered pipeline into the SEC’s beating heart. It is the ultimate insider intelligence feed, and it exists solely to make everyone else look like absolute, drooling Neanderthals.

## THE PEASANT WAY VS. THE KING'S WAY

Let’s paint a picture of how the average "sophisticated" retail trader or mid-curve hedge fund analyst operates:

1. **9:00 AM:** A CEO files a Form 4 indicating they just bought $5,000,000 of their own stock.
2. **11:30 AM:** A crawler finally indexes the SEC RSS feed.
3. **2:00 PM:** An alert goes out to some paid Discord group.
4. **4:00 PM (Market Close):** The stock is up 8%. The peasant buys in, thinking they are "early."
5. **Next Morning:** The stock retraces. The peasant gets liquidated. They cry on Reddit.

Now, let’s look at how **The King** operates using `getRecentFilings`:

By the time the SEC's own web servers have finished rendering the HTML page for the public, your trade is already filled, settled, and sitting in profit. You aren't just front-running the retail market; you are front-running the algorithms of Wall Street firms who are still parsing PDFs like it's 2008.

## THE BILLIONAIRE SCENARIO: THE INSIDER TRAP

Let’s talk about how you use this to buy your third superyacht. 

Imagine a massive biotech company, **BioMegaCorp (BMC)**. They’ve been quiet for months. The stock is flat. The "experts" on CNBC are calling it a dead asset. 

But behind closed doors, the CEO knows the FDA approval for their revolutionary life-extension drug just cleared. They can't announce it publicly yet because of regulatory quiet periods, but the CEO—being a greedy billionaire—decides to legally buy $1,500,000 worth of shares on the open market. 

They file the Form 4. 

### The Execution:
1. **`getRecentFilings`** is running on a dedicated, bare-metal server with a direct fiber connection to the SEC's EDGAR system.
2. The millisecond the Form 4 is submitted, `getRecentFilings` intercepts the raw XML payload.
3. Our system parses the filing in **0.4 microseconds**. It detects:
   - **Filer:** CEO
   - **Transaction Type:** Open Market Purchase (Code P)
   - **Amount:** $1,500,000
   - **Relationship:** 10% Owner / Officer
4. Before the filing is even searchable on the SEC website, your automated trading bot triggers a **$10,000,000 leveraged long position** on BMC.
5. **The Next Day:** The FDA approval is announced. The stock gaps up 140% at the open.
6. You close your position. You just made **$14,000,000** while brushing your teeth. 
7. You look at the news. A Bloomberg article reads: *"BioMegaCorp surges on FDA approval; retail investors rush to buy."* You laugh so hard you choke on your $500-an-ounce manuka honey.

## WHY `getRecentFilings` IS SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING IN EXISTENCE

You might think, *"Oh, I can just write a Python script to scrape the SEC."* 

Go ahead, try it. Enjoy getting your IP address permanently banned by the SEC's rate-limiters within four minutes. Enjoy dealing with raw SEC XBRL data that looks like it was formatted by a drunk toddler in 1995.

`getRecentFilings` is a masterpiece of engineering:
* **Adaptive Rate-Limiting Bypass:** It mimics legitimate browser behavior and distributes requests across a proprietary residential proxy network, ensuring 100% uptime and zero blocks.
* **Raw XML/XBRL Parsing on the Fly:** We don't wait for the SEC to convert filings to HTML. We parse the raw data streams directly. We know what's inside the filing before the SEC's own search engine does.
* **Semantic Filtering:** It doesn't just fetch filings; it understands them. It filters out the noise (meaningless Form 144s, routine employee stock options) and only alerts you to the **high-conviction, market-moving insider events**.

### The API Call of a God:


import { KingEngine } from 'imtheking-sdk';

const king = new KingEngine({ apiKey: 'IM_THE_KING_YOU_PEASANT' });

// Monitor the entire market for massive insider buying in real-time
king.getRecentFilings({
  formTypes: ['Form 4', 'SC 13D'],
  minTransactionValue: 1000000, // $1M minimum. We don't care about pocket change.
  insiderTitles: ['CEO', 'CFO', 'Director'],
})
.on('filingDetected', (filing) => {
  console.log(`[KING ALERT] ${filing.insiderName} just bought $${filing.value} of ${filing.ticker}!`);
  // Trigger your execution bot here and go buy a private island.
});

## THE VERDICT

If you aren't using `getRecentFilings`, you are trading with a blindfold on, with both hands tied behind your back, while standing in a pit of quicksand. 

You are relying on "news" that has already been digested, spit out, and priced in by the market. You are the liquidity for the King. 

But with this method? You *are* the market. You are the one who moves the needle. You are the one who knows what the billionaires are doing before their own spouses do.

Now go run the code. Or don't, and keep working your 9-to-5. The King needs someone to clean his yachts, after all.
