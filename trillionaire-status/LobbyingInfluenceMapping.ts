    abstract: "Each of four theoretical traditions in American politics—Majoritarian Electoral Democracy, Economic-Elite Domination, Majoritarian Pluralism, and Biased Pluralism—is tested using a unique data set that includes measures of the policy preferences of average citizens, affluent citizens, and interest groups on 1,779 policy issues. Multivariate analysis indicates that economic elites and organized groups representing business interests have substantial independent impacts on U.S. government policy, while average citizens and mass-based interest groups have little or no independent influence.",
    keyFindings: [
      "Economic elites have an estimated influence coefficient of ~0.78 on policy outcomes when controlling for average voter preferences.",
      "Business interest groups possess nearly double the influence of mass-based interest groups.",
      "When average citizens oppose a policy supported by economic elites, the probability of passage drops to near zero (~5%)."
