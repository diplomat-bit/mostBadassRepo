## SECTION 1: EXECUTIVE MANDATE & DEEP RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
Analyse SEC DEF 14A proxy statements, corporate bylaws, Delaware DGCL precedents, and academic findings (Jensen & Meckling, Bebchuk, Masulis, Cheffins, Acemoglu) to build a hyper-resilient corporate-sovereign governance framework.

### KEY RESEARCH TASKS:
1. **Board Composition & Fiduciary Mechanics**: Quantify independence ratios, SOX 404 financial expertise, and committee interlocks.
2. **Capital Class & Super-Voting Shares**: Implement 100:1 high-vote founder stock with protective Delaware DGCL § 102(b)(7) charters.
3. **Executive Pay & Clawbacks**: Link compensation to ROIC and TSR while maintaining Dodd-Frank mandatory clawbacks.
4. **Activist Defense**: Combine classified board structures, advance notice bylaws (120-150 days), and poison pill triggers (15%).
5. **Sovereign Legal Execution**: Integrate instant FedNow/ISO 20022 money settlement, automated real estate title deed acquisition, and sovereign taxation optimization.
